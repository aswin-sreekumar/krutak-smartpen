### Brief overview
The Smart Digital Pen is a plug and play optical pen which can be used to draw digitally on any surface. The canvas size is not limited by the surface size and feels more natural like writing with an actual pen. It is wired and supports USB connectivity. A python script is used for opening a white canvas window and the pen can be used to draw digitally. The words written using the pen is automatically recognized and converted upon request and is displayed in a separate window. The USB cord is 85 cm in length, making it well sufficient to support large workspaces. 

A switch is provided at the side well within reach of the thumb. The switch must be pressed to draw or write on the digital canvas. The cursor simply hovers when the button is not pressed, in case there is a break in writing.

Upon clicking the switch twice, the auto-recognition will take place and the processed text will appear in a window.
